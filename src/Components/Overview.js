        <p>
          Helping Hut NGO was started with a vibrant vision to create a NO
          beggar environment around us and ensure every needy gets the right of
          living. Its mission is to provide employment opportunities to as many
          beggars as it can and make society beggar free.

        <p>
          Being started like a drop of help in the ocean of problems people face
          in their life, Helping Hut NGO aims to cater to all those in need. To
          feed the starving, to bring a small ray of happiness by doing small
          things actually do not need a million dollars and with little love,
          little care and a little change to our lifestyles, we as people can
          create an impact on someone's life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helping Hut NGO thus organises various activities which include online
          campaigns, ground work and enthusiastic competitions to bring out the
          best in you. Some of our online campaigns were on to save water, to
          plant more trees and the most impactful Utthan Abhiyan which was a
          step towards awareness of government policies to the needy one.
          Various competitions organised touched many aspects of our life
          through art and craft, poetry, creative writing and enhancing
          knowledge through quizzes. The topics selected were interesting as
          well as important in one's life such as 'Health and Unite India' ,
          'Mental Health and Corona as a Medical and Social Problem' and many
          more.

          Ground work encourages our helping hut soldiers to bring a smile on a
          needy's face through their constant efforts. It also helps to spread
          awareness among the people. It included distribution drives of masks,
          education kits, clothes etc. It also included the noble work of
          spreading education among urban poor and rural children so that they
          can also get an opportunity to fly with their wings of education and
          soar to great heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, Helping Hut NGO started with a single ray of help wishes to
          spread like sunshine and to bring people out of darkness of deprived
          knowledge and resources. We work to ensure every needy gets the right
          of living.
