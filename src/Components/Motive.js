            “A vision is not just a picture of what could be; it is an appeal to
            our better selves, a call to become something more” -Rosabeth Moss

            We at HELPING HUT NGO envision building a just and compassionate
            society by organizing various drives, campaigns, interactive
            sessions, and raising funds for the needy in order to make this
            world a better place to live in.

          Our <br /> Aim

        <div>
          <p>
            TO PUT AN END TO BEGGARY Beggary is not an option for livelihood. We
            aim to provide beggars occupation for their livelihood which is
            totally suitable for them and beneath their ability

            EDUCATION FOR EVERYONE Money should not be a reason for poor kids
            not getting an education. We provide free education to poor children
            rural areas

        </h2>

            Our non-profit organization exists with the core mission to create a
            world where everyone has a decent place to live and to leave a
            sustainable world for future generations. We work to ensure that
            every needy person gets their right to living. We are a bunch of
            students who formed this NGO with the visions like helping poor in
            any way possible, stopping beggary by giving them some occupation
            and helping poor kids in getting education. And we aim to achieve
            that by collecting monthly funds from our team and volunteers and
            later spend that fund on implementation of our vision. We start at
            least 2 campaigns per month to achieve our goals sustainably
